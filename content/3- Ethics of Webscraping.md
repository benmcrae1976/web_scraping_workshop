## Getting started  

Scraping the web for data is

excellent for publically available content - 
probelmatic where there are people involved - privacy issues - 
not so cool to try and scrape data from behind a paywall and so on

examples of webscraping gone bad - 




[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a standard to [simplify writing](https://evanwill.github.io/_drafts/notes/writing-markdown.html) content for the web. 
[GitHub markdown flavor](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) can be used any where on GitHub and in Jekyll.
The basics are intuitive, you can learn in about a minute!
See [Markdown in a Minute](https://evanwill.github.io/_drafts/notes/markdown-minute.html) to get started.

At the top of each page is "YML front matter" used to configure the page.
Use these options:

- to include a page in the header and footer navigation, add `nav:` push the text you want to appear to the file's yml front matter. Alternatively, add `nav: true` to use the page's `title:` value. All pages with a `nav` value will appear in the top-bar, sorted by order of filenames. For simplicity use leading numbers in the lesson page filenames to create correct order.
- `title:` value will appear as `h1` at the top of the page.
- `topics:` will appear as a small feature below the title (optional). 
- `description:` will appear as an indented text block below the title (optional). This gives you a chance to summarize the section contents. 
- `youtubeid:` will add an YouTube video embed (optional). Find the id in the YouTube link. For example, in `https://youtu.be/moJgWrD6dwg` or `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moJgWrD6dwg` the youtubeid is `moJgWrD6dwg`.
- Alternatively, if you don't want `title` or other options to appear on the page, you can over ride the layout by adding `layout: default` 

## Ethical consderations

Befor scraping-
is the data feely publically available

what are the permissions as set by the page owners (robots.txt)

are there people involved?  could their identity or privacy be compromised?

API?
written permissions



`workshop-template-b` contains a series of [Liquid "includes"](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/) to add basic [Bootstrap components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/) to your Markdown content.
Examples below demonstrate the includes.

--------

## good practice/bad practice

`{% raw %}{% include figure.html img="uidaho-workshop.jpg" alt="workshop scene" caption="Library workshops!" width="75%" %}{% endraw %}`

{% include figure.html img="uidaho-workshop.jpg" alt="workshop scene" caption="Library workshops!" width="75%" %}

----------

#### Alerts

`{% raw %}{% include alert.html text="This is a Bootstrap [Alert](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/alerts/)" align="center" color="success" %}{% endraw %}`

{% include alert.html text="This is a [Bootstrap Alert](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/alerts/)" align="center" color="success" %}

-----------

#### Link Buttons 

`{% raw %}{% include button.html text="Bootstrap Docs" link="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/buttons/" color="info" %}{% endraw %}`

{% include button.html text="Bootstrap Docs" link="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/buttons/" color="info" %}

---------

#### Cards

```{% raw %}
{% capture text %}
1. Can add more complex text using markdown.
2. Use a Liquid capture to create the text.
3. It magically becomes a [Bootstrap Card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/card/).
{% endcapture %}
{% include card.html text=text header="Example Card" title="Title example" img="uidaho-workshop.jpg" %}{% endraw %}
```
